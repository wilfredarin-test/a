    “The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the
ones who do.” –I strongly believe in these words of Steve Jobs.<br><br>
I welcome all new members in team CSRL and wish to share my thoughts
which are aligned to the above mentioned quote. We aim at achieving a
mutual goal of creating excellence in anything that we do in the organisation,
and this is only possible when we sincerely criticize our work and start learning
from each one.<br><br>
In the recent past, I have observed that following 7 challenges faced by CSRL
are critical to our productivity. We all need to ponder on these and find a way
out.<br><br><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Less of Admissions in IITs &amp; A-grade Institutions-</span> This cause is disappointing
our sponsors and associates. Going forward, we cannot focus just on the
number of qualifications in JEE Mains and Advance but overall on admissions.<br><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Weak Branding</span> - We barely share the stories and news of our organisation on
social media, we have yet not added our beneficiaries in ‘CSRL Alumni’ FB
group which helps us create a brand of our own. With over 3000 ex-
beneficiaries, we only have ~ 700 students in the group as of day.<br><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">High-Performance Management –</span> We need to understand and work on High
Performance Management, our work has to be time-bound as well as quality-
bound.<br><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Lacking commitment-</span> We do work hard but we also have to take ownership.
We need to work with passion and with commitment.<br><br>
<span style="font-weight:bold">Adherence to Standards:</span> We have shared a lot many policies of recruitment
selection, safety; however we can do more in adhering to those. We need to
understand that the policies are made for our benefits and keeping growth in
mind. <span style="font-weight:bold">Quality, if not assured, jeopardizes the sustainability in long run.</span><br><br><span style="font-weight:bold">Lack of innovation in selection –</span> This is one of the most important
determinants of success and so far our experienced PM(s) have seldom
experimented in finding ways to select the best students in lesser expense. I
am sure if all of us start thinking on this, we shall surely come with brilliant
suggestions.<br><br>

<span style="font-weight:bold">Lack of sense of urgency-</span> We need to act now. The mantra for all of us. Go
crazy and grow impatient in acheving the best.<br><br>
However, I must admit here that I take pride in the strength of CSRL such as
satisfaction of sponsors, manpower stability, and systems and processes in
place to some extent, full support of the board and strong academics and all of
You. I am confident that each of you can bring a change.<br><br>
To conclude, we have set a vision of 2020, that is to achieve <span style="font-weight:bold">175 admissions in
IITs, 180 admissions in A- group Institutions (other than IITs), 250 admissions
in NITs other than those listed in A group and 150 admissions in B grade
institutions.</span><br><br>
Let’s go get it!
