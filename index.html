        achieving a mutual goal of excellence was organised by Mr Shahi.  All the staff
        of the Head Office was present at the meeting.The meeting intended to
        provide an overview of current challenges faced by CSRL and to involve
        everyone in setting targets for 2019-20.<br><br>
        Mr Shahi discussed nine major challenges that are our hampering the image
        and pace of productivity of the organisation. The challenges which were
        discussed during the meeting, were as follows:<br>
        <ol>
          <li>Rumours spread by Mr.Baleshwar Rai &amp; Anand Kumar</li>
         <li>Admissions in IITs &amp; A- grade Institutions</li>
         <li>Weak Branding</li>
         <li>High-Performance Management (Lacking commitment)</li>
         <li>Adherence to Standards: Poor</li>
         <li>Change in top management in PSUs</li> 
         <li>Business Diversification</li> 
         <li>Innovation in selection and</li>
         <li> Lack of sense of urgency</li>
        </ol>

        <br>
        The strengths of CSRL were also discussed. The strengths that were highlighted
        and believed to take the organisation even farther are as follows: satisfaction
        of sponsors, near stable manpower, systems &amp; processes in place up to some
        extent, full support of the board and strong academics.<br><br>
        In the second part of the meeting, everyone collectively focussed on the future
        view and discussed radical enhancement in the speed of action. Vision for
        2019-2020 was set that we would try to achieve 175 admissions in IITs, 180
        admissions in A- group Institutions (other than IITs), 250 admissions in NITs
        other than those listed in A group and 150 admissions in B grade institutions.<br><br>
        Later on, Centres which are on high alert and are to be put on review by the
        academic advisor on priority basis were highlighted. The centres are as
        follows: OMC BBS, Oil India Itanagar, NTPC &amp; CONCOR-Varanasi, Kashmir, and
        IOC Patna &amp; Noida.<br><br>
        Finally, the meeting ended with a discussion on readiness for 2019-20. The
        information on upcoming projects was given. The list of the upcoming project
        is as follows: IOC-Chennai, NFL-Chandigarh, ONGC- Tripura, IOC Petronas-
        Kolkata, and PLL- Delhi for Kashmir (Part of PLL- Kashmir Super 30). Mr Shahi
        motivated everyone to keep their belief stronger than steel. Everyone felt
        extremely encouraged and rolled up their sleeves to work efficiently for the
        newly set targets.<br><br>
